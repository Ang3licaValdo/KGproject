# KGproject

KGProject is a knowledge graph about scientific papers, itâ€™s been enriched with
information about authors obtained from Wikidata and about organizations
from ROR.

You can make queries to our KG to get the next information about the 30 papers:
- Title of the papers
- Authors of the papers
- Organizations acknowledged
- Information about the authors, such as:
   - The organization they're members of.
   - Their date of birth
   - Occupation
   - Country of citinzenship
   - Official website
   - Gender
   - Place of study
- Information about the organizations and publishers acknowledged, such as:
   - The location
   - Official website 
   - ROR URI 
- The probability of belonging to each topic.

*NOTE: Some information may not be found because it might not be available for the specific instance on the information sources used to enrich our KG.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker compose

## How to execute it
Our enriched knowledge graph is in a turtle file (.ttl), to get it and to be able to query it, you can download this repository and change directories until you are inside the 'compose' directory:

```
cd ./development/docker/compose
```
Then execute the next command:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
At the beginning of the execution of the prior command, you'll see something like this:
```
compose-jena-fuseki-1  | ###################################
compose-jena-fuseki-1  | Initializing Apache Jena Fuseki
compose-jena-fuseki-1  | 
compose-jena-fuseki-1  | Randomly generated admin password:
compose-jena-fuseki-1  | 
compose-jena-fuseki-1  | admin=zw2qhz63j5QfuIS
compose-jena-fuseki-1  | 
compose-jena-fuseki-1  | ###################################
```
Make sure you keep that password.

Then wait till you get this message "compose-rdfs-1 exited with code 0", so now you will have the .ttl file inside the directory ./compose/ttls

Then head over to localhost:3030 on your browser and introduce the password, then upload the .ttl file and now you can start to query it.

To stop the containers use:
```
docker-compose down
```
